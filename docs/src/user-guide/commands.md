## Autocomplete

![Slash command autocomplete](../slash-command-menu.png)

When you type `/`, a popup appears showing matching commands. As you continue
typing, the list filters down. Use:

- **Up/Down arrows** to navigate the list
- **Tab** to complete the selected command
- **Esc** to dismiss the popup

### /join autocomplete

After typing `/join `, a second autocomplete popup shows matching contacts and
groups. Filter by name or phone number. Groups are shown in green. Press Tab to
complete the selection.

## Examples

**Join a conversation by name:**
```
/join Alice
```

**Join by phone number:**
```
/j +15551234567
```

**Toggle direct message notifications off:**
```
/bell direct
```

**Toggle all notifications:**
```
/bell
```

**Mute the current conversation:**
```
/mute
```

**Mute for a specific duration:**
```
/mute 1h
/mute 8h
/mute 1d
/mute 1w
```

Timed mutes show remaining time in the sidebar (e.g. `~2h`) and auto-unmute
when they expire.

**Search for a message:**
```
/search hello
```

**Attach a file:**
```
/attach
```

This opens a file browser. Navigate with `j`/`k`, Enter to select a file or
enter a directory, Backspace to go up. The selected file attaches to your next
message.

**Paste a screenshot from clipboard:**
```
/paste
```

If the clipboard contains an image (e.g. a screenshot), it's saved as a temp PNG
and staged as an attachment. If it contains text, the text is inserted into the
input buffer.

**Block the current conversation:**
```
/block
```

**Set disappearing messages to 1 day:**
```
/disappearing 1d
```

**Disable disappearing messages:**
```
/dm off
```

**Open group management:**
```
/group
```

This opens a menu with options to view members, add/remove members, rename the
group, create a new group, or leave. Only available in group conversations
(except create, which works anywhere).

**Switch color theme:**
```
/theme
```

**Create a poll:**
```
/poll "Lunch?" "Pizza" "Sushi" "Tacos"
```

**Create a single-select poll:**
```
/poll "Best editor?" "Vim" "Emacs" --single
```

**Verify a contact's identity:**
```
/verify
```

**Edit your Signal profile:**
```
/profile
```

Navigate fields with `j`/`k`, press Enter to edit a field inline, Enter again
to confirm (or Esc to cancel). Move to Save and press Enter to push changes.

**Show app info:**
```
/about
```

**Export chat history:**
```
/export
```

Exports all messages in the current conversation to a text file in your Downloads
directory (e.g. `siggy-export-Alice-2026-03-14.txt`).

**Export last 50 messages:**
```
/export 50
```

## Messaging a new contact

To start a conversation with someone not in your sidebar, use `/join` with their
phone number in E.164 format:

```
/join +15551234567
```

The conversation will appear in your sidebar once the first message is exchanged.
